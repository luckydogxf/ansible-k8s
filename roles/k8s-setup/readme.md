# How to use it ?

``` ansible-playbook site.yml -i 172.16.215.162, -u ubuntu -k -b ```

or write your own inventory files.

# What's the next ?

1. Go to master nodes, run 

``` kubeadm token create --print-join-command ```

would show the command to join a worker node.

2. what if it is a mater node ?

``` kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs```

3. run step 3 again.

```
<join command from step 03> --control-plane --certificate-key <key from step 01>

```
